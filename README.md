## Hi, I'm [Yilun Kuang](https://yilunkuang.github.io/) 👋

- I'm a Machine Learning PhD Student at [NYU Center for Data Science (NYU CDS)](https://cds.nyu.edu/) and [NYU CILVR Group](https://wp.nyu.edu/cilvr/)
- I graduated magna cum laude from New York University with a BA in Mathematics with high honors in Spring 2023
- I grew up in Shenzhen, China and have lived in Claremont, California and New York City

### What I Work on 🧑‍💻
I am an AI researcher with a focus on Deep Learning. More specifically, I am interested in

- Probabilistic Generative Models, Large Language Models, Multimodal Learning, NeuroAI & AI for Science
- Self-Supervised Representation Learning, Generalization Theory, Distribution Shift, Representational Geometry

<!---
Beyond my current academic pursuits, I am also passionate about applying machine learning in real world settings. Thus, I have done 1) software engineering projects in [deploying SaaS machine learning service over IBM Cloud Kubernetes](https://github.com/YilunKuang/Scalable-MNIST-on-Kubernetes) and 2) quantitative finance projects in [integrating gaussian process changepoint detections into momentum trading pipeline for currency trading](https://github.com/charliezchen/currency-change-point-detection).
