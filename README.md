## Hi, I'm [Yilun Kuang](https://yilunkuang.github.io/) üëã

- I'm an incoming PhD Student in Data Science at [NYU Center for Data Science (NYU CDS)](https://cds.nyu.edu/)
- I'm a fourth year undergrad in Honors Mathematics and Computer Science at New York University
- I'm currently working as a [research assistant](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/people/yilun-kuang/) at Flatiron Institute, Simons Foundation
- I grew up in Shenzhen, China and have lived in Claremont, California and New York City

### What I Work on üßë‚Äçüíª
I am an aspiring AI researcher with a focus on Deep Learning. More specifically, I am interested in

- Self-Supervised Representation Learning, Probabilistic Generative Modeling, NeuroAI & AI for Science
- Task-Efficient Manifold Geometry, Gaussian Process and Neural Tangent Kernel, Bayesian Deep Learning

Beyond my current academic pursuits, I am also passionate about applying machine learning in real world settings. Thus, I have done 1) software engineering projects in [deploying SaaS machine learning service over IBM Cloud Kubernetes](https://github.com/YilunKuang/Scalable-MNIST-on-Kubernetes) and 2) quantitative finance projects in [integrating gaussian process changepoint detections into momentum trading pipeline for currency trading](https://github.com/charliezchen/currency-change-point-detection).
